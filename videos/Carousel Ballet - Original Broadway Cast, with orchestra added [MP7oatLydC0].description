With Bambi Linn, Annabelle Lyon, and Robert Pagent.  This film of Agnes DeMille's dance was made with only a piano accompaniment, so I've added the orchestral music.  But there is no complete recording of the ballet that matches  the piano used for this film, so I had to cut together three different recordings, changing the speeds to match the dance.  Interesting that the filmed ballet was always much faster than the audio versions.
